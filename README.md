# Monty Hall Probabilities Trial
This project will simulate the [Monty Hall problem ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem).

> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

A simple solution using conditional probability shows that the player has a 2/3 chance of winning if they switch.

In this case study, we will prove this to be true in the long run through random experiments and then comparing the outcome of switching or not switching doors.
